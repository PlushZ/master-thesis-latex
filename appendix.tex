        \subsubsection{Existing Galaxy workflows that were not changed} \label{sec:appendix:figures:wfs}
        Other existing Galaxy workflows for SARS-CoV-2 clinical data surveillanve that were not taken as a basis for improvement and repurposing in this thesis are presented in \cref{fig:further:ont-wf} and \cref{fig:further:illumina-wf}.
